# Bachelor's Project: 2D Game Engine for Embedded Systems

This project focuses on developing a 2D Game engine for low-cost embedded systems. \
My implementation is based on RP2040 microcontroller found on boards like Raspberry Pi Pico and Marble Pico.\

**RP2040**
RP2040 is a 32-bit dual ARM Cortex-M0+ microcontroller produced by Raspberry Pi Ltd.
This project is written in C++ but the microcontroller can also be programmed in MicroPython, Assembly, Rust, Go/\

Key features:
    - Dual ARM Cortex-M0+ cores 133Mhz.
    - 264 KB SRAM 
    - 30 GPIO Pins
    - Two UART controllers
    - Two SPI controllers
    - 16 PWM Channels.

The RP2040 Datasheet can be found [here] (https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf) .
